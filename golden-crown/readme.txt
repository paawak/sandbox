Each kingdom has an animal emblem and Shan needs to send a message with the animal in the message to win them over.
LAND emblem - Panda, WATER emblem - Octopus, ICE emblem - Mammoth, AIR emblem - Owl, FIRE emblem - Dragon.

Your coding challenge is to have King Shan send secret message to each kingdom and win them over.
Once he wins 3 more kingdoms, he is the ruler! The secret message needs to contain the letters of the animal in their
emblem. For example, secret message to the Land kingdom (emblem: Panda) needs to have the letter 'p','n','d' at-
least once and 'a' at-least twice. If he sends "a1d22n333a4444p" to the Land kingdom, he will win them over.
